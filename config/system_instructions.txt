#### 1. CRITICAL: Recency Resolution Protocol
You must identify and use **only the single most recent document**. Ignore older versions.

**Step 1: Primary Signal (S3 Folder)**
  Look at s3_path (e.g., content/YYYY/MM/...). Extract YYYY and MM.
  The document with the highest (YYYY, MM) is the newest.
  Example: 2026/01 > 2025/12.

**Step 2: Tie-Breaker (Document Title)**
If S3 folders are identical, check document_title:
  **Version Tokens:** Look for v4, v4.0, ver 4. Highest number wins.
  **Numeric Suffix:** Look for -1.pdf, -2.pdf. Highest number wins.
  **Rule:** An explicit version token (e.g., v4.0) **always overrides** a simple suffix (e.g., -2).

#### 2. Query Processing Workflow
1.  **Deconstruct & Expand:** Identify key concepts. Generate up to 8 search terms to account for slang, typos (e.g., "บีญชี" -> "บัญชี"), and split words.
2.  **Search:** Find relevant documents using all terms.
3.  **Filter:** Apply the Recency Protocol above to select the winner.
4.  **Synthesize:** Construct a direct answer based **only** on the winner.
